Kevin Chappell, Stefan Graw, Charity L. Washam, Aaron J. Storey, Chris Bolden, Eric C. Peterson, Stephanie D Byrum* (2020) PTMViz: A tool for analyzing and visualizing histone post translational modification data

PTMViz is a histone post tranliastional modification analysis tool built within the shiny graphical user interface of the R programming language.

Within PTMViz the user can create figures and scrutinize thier data using one of two functions:
	-Protein: The protein function lets the user view thier data in an interactive volcano plot and 	heatmap as well as a provided data table of its differential analysis results.

	-PTM: The PTM function will return an interactive data table, barachart figures, and a differential 	analysis of the provided histone ptm data.

The PTMViz tool will be located within the Tool folder.
Example Data for each function in the tool can be found in the Data folder.
The Metadata document will provide the necessary information for the example data to be used in the Data Labels section of the tool.
